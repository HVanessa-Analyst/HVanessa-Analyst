## Project Summary


Sure! Here's a short summary of all the projects you've completed during your MSBA program over the past three months:

Summary of MSBA Projects (Past Three Months)

During my Master of Science in Business Analytics program, I have worked on several data-driven projects that required applying analytical techniques, statistical modeling, and business insights to real-world scenarios.

Customer Churn Analysis: Developed an ROC curve (k=8) to compare classifier performance, evaluating sensitivity and false positive rates.
Retail Shortages Investigation: Conducted a consulting analysis on a retailer’s shortages, using transaction data, price trends, and revenue impact to provide actionable insights.
AstraSync RFP Decision Modeling: Designed a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate AstraSync’s AI/ML bid strategy, incorporating gain-share rewards and risk assessment.
NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction: Analyzed passenger count, distance, and fare amount to predict taxi trip duration accurately using regression models.
Virginia Beach Crime Analysis: Built a Tableau dashboard to visualize crime trends across police patrol zones using incident data and priority classifications.
Netflix Forecasting & Model Evaluation: Developed ETS and TSLM forecasting models in R for Netflix subscriber growth, performing cross-validation and accuracy testing.
Airline Overbooking Simulation: Modeled Alaska Airlines’ SEA-SFO no-show rates, optimizing overbooking strategies using a 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulation.
SQL Data Warehouse & ERD Design: Constructed an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) and data warehouse using Virginia’s open data portal for structured analytics.
Through these projects, I have refined my skills in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Excel, and decision modeling, while developing a strong understanding of data-driven problem-solving and business analytics applications.
